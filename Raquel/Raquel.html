                Competition climbing is a form of regulated rock-climbing competition held indoors on purpose-built artificial climbing walls, and it is regulated by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) This sport was introduced was featured at the Summer Olympics for the first time in 2020. There are three disciplines of competition climbing: lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing.

                    In competition lead climbing, the competitors have 6 minutes to climb a 15-metre sport climbing route. For the safety of their safety, they must clip their safety rope into the various quickdraws while they ascend the route. The climber is allowed one single attempt at the route, and their score is determined by the highest artificial hold number that they "controlled" before falling. Between rounds, the competitors are collectively given 6 minutes to inspect — but not attempt or practice — the next route. After the brief inspection, they are kept in an isolation area to prevent them from observing other competitors on the route.

                    In competition bouldering, the competitors must "solve" multiple short 4.5-metre bouldering problems over a set time (usually 5 minutes), with the fewest falls. The competitors do not use a rope or any climbing protection, but crash pads that are laid across the ground for safety. Each problem has an official start position for all four of the competitor's limbs. The competitor is judged to have completed the problem when they have placed their two hands on the "top" hold and held it long enough to receive confirmation from the judge. The final score is determined by the overall number of routes "topped", the most "zone holds" reached, and the number of attempts needed. As with competition lead climbing, the competitors cannot see each other's attempts.

                <p>
                    In competition speed climbing, the competitors race to ascend a 15-metre standardised climbing wall, where, unlike leading climbing or bouldering, the holds are always the exact same size and placed in the exact same location. As the emphasis is on speed, the climbers do not have the time to clip into quickdraws, and instead use an auto-belay top rope for climbing protection. In qualification, competitors race in pairs in Lane A and Lane B; they race twice, once in each lane. In the finals, competitors race against each other in elimination rounds, with the winner, regardless of time, advancing until the ultimate winner is decided.
