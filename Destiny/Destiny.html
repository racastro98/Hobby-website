                        weight machines or free weights, like dumbbells or barbells, at home or a gym. It stresses and
                        strengthens your muscles over time.

                            <p>
                                Weight Training is not a competitive sport, instead is is a training system.However,
                                some people who enjoy this go on to become powerlifters. Powerlifting is a strength
                                sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench
                                press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete
                                attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates.

                            Why do I enjoy weight training?
                            <p>
                              I enjoy strength training I enjoy strength training for a plethora of reasons. The first reason is the fact that weight lifting is physically empowering, it allows me to build the physique that I want , while I improve my overall fitness levels. The feeling of achieving personal goals boosts my confidence. It is a very effective stress reliever, whenever I have had a long day or I am feeling anxious going to the gym allows me to feel better, this could be due to the endorphins released during a workout, improving my mental health. Despite what social media may show us being a part of the gym means being a part of a community; people are always encouraging me to go harder and if I fail I feel encouraged to keep going and lastly, strength training is a fun way to be competitive within yourself, it is a way to block out the world with your music and focus on something else.
